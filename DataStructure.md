## Data Structure

A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in the computer memory so that we can perform our operations efficiently. 

### Types of Data Structure

1. Static Data Structure

In these types of data structure, memeory size is fixed. So we have to know what is the maximum size to be used, as memory cannot be reallocated at a later point. 
Examples: Arrays

2. Dynamic Data Structure

Memory size is dynamic ie we can increase or decrease memeory size at the runtime. 
Examples: LinkedList, Trees, Graph
