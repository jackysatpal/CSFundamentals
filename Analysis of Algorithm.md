## Time Complexity

An algorithm is a step-by-step list of instructions used to perform an ultimate task.

How do we identify which algorithm is efficient and less efficient?
The answer is time and space complexity.

The time complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by an algorithm to complete it's execution. 

The time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the input size. i.e. how an algorithm scales when the input gets huge.
Will my program be able to solve a large practical input?

With respect to the input size, how does your algorithm grows?

Time Complexity is often measured in terms of:
Big Oh(O): worst case scenario
Big Omegha: best case scenario
Big Theta: average case scenario

We analyze time complexity for 2 reasons:
1. For very large input size
2. Worst case scenario


Some of the input types and common factors that are scalling:
Input | Common factor that is scalling
--- | ---
Integer | Magnitude of number
String | Length of String
Array | Length of Array
LinkedList | Number of nodes
Tree | Number of nodes
HashTable | Number of key-value pairs
Matrix | Width and height of matrix
Graph | Number of vertices and edges

### Space Complexity

How much space or memory does your algorithm takes to execute it.
Here memory means RAM because programs run on RAM memory.
