## Stack 

A stack is an abstract data type where insertion and deletion of an element happens in one direction only. This means last element that was inserted would be the first one to removed. Hence it is also knows as LIFO (Last In First Out).

A Stack has 2 primarily main operations:

1. Push: push an element
2. Pop: remove an element that was recently inserted

### Applications

1. Undo Mechanism
2. Call stack

### Complexity

Operation | Complexity
--- | ---
Push | O(1)
Pop | O(1)
Peek | O(1)

Space complexity of Stack is O(n)
